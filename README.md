# WebDev_Project_JMC

Our project aims to create an accessable and exciting website for client for 'Enchanted Locks', a hair salon ran by Nina Thompson.
We will build a vibrant, enchanting website that makes it easy for people to navigate through different functions like booking 
an appointment or viewing the gallery!
